# Algo-Visual

## Description
Algorithms can be difficult to visualize in your head. Algo-Visual has a simple interface that allows you to observe algorithms in action!

## Visualizations
Currently two algorithms are visualized: 
- Cellular Automata Cave Generation
- Flood fill

## Cave Generation
There is an excellent article explaining the logic behind the cellular automata cave generation method here:

## Technologies
- JavaScript
- HTML + SCSS
- React
